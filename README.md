# Boundary Element Method for Quantum Billiards

Spectrum solver for 2D Helmholtz quantum billiard problems. Implements a Boundary Element Method (BEM) to construct boundary data, assemble boundary integral operators, and scan wavenumbers to approximate resonant modes. Includes simple spectrum and billiard visualisations.

## Overview (with scientific backing)

## Features
list of things it can do 

## Quickstart example

(maybe merge the above 2)


## Structure

## installation

this clones the repo and opens the project
> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantumBilliards.jl.git
> cd QuantumBilliards.jl

this deals with dependencies when run in the julia REPL
> using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()
