# Boundary Element Method for Quantum Billiards

Spectrum solver for 2D Helmholtz quantum billiard problems. Implements a Boundary Element Method (BEM) to construct boundary data, assemble boundary integral operators, and scan wavenumbers to approximate resonant modes. Includes simple spectrum and billiard visualisations.
